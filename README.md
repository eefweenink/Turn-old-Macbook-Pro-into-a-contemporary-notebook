# Turn-old-Macbook-Pro-into-a-contemporary-notebook

This writing is done, because I forget the details, when doing a project and next time I have to re-invent all again.
And maybe it is of some kind of help to anyone who, like me wants that old Macbook Pro run those new applications. 
I started buying a Macbook Pro long time ago (2014) and used it untill short time ago (and now it is donated and keeps running as before). 
2-3 years ago I read about tools to make the newest MacOS run on old Macbooks and by now I did installations on about 5-6 different Macbooks, from 2012 to 2015. 
I get a bit better in it, and maybe one day I will be an expert ;-) 

# Introduction
This "HowTo" help will not be a chronilogical version of my findings (that would be a very long story, and hard to understand). So I cut it down in a couple of stages, what can be done with some "ease:

## Step 1: Get yourself a Macbook Pro
Almost any model can be used to run the latest MacOs versions. To use a Macbook as a standalone Windows machine, it needs an Intel processor. 
These can be found in Macbook Pro's up till about 2018. The younger the notebook the more expensive. So I would search for a notebook from 2013 or later (2012 or older is also possible, but not so fast etcetera). 
If you can choose: i7 is better then i5; more memory is better then less (best is 16 GB i7 but for "non-gaming" applications 4Gb i5 is nice). 
SSD-disks can be changed later. Some ideas on my 3 notebooks:
- 2013 i5 dual Core 8 gB as Windows10 (only) replacement for a "toooo slooooow" Acer from 2017.
- 2015 i5 8 gb, my experimental machine: MacOs Sequoia; Windows10, Linux Mint and some space left for fast and dirty OS installations. 
- 2015 i7 16 gB, my serious work machine, only MacOs Seqouia. (the less used of the 3 ;-) ) 
When buying:
- check the display. When there is bluryy, stripy, whatever stuff on the screen. That is hard to repair. Can only be done by screen replacement and these are rare to find and expensive to buy.
- It should boot, not needed that it boots to the SSD itself, but if there is a question mark on the screen, then you get it probably running. 
- check for waterdamage, gives stupid errors and almost not to repair (easily). 
- prices? Can differe very much per season, country, model. For my 3 machines the average was about â‚¬ 150,- (including some small stuff like a rubber, screws, HDMI dummy plug)

## Step 2: Clean the machine
- Unpack what you bought, just some hot water + dishwashingsoap is good enought to wipe it off (do not make it wet!). Also use this soap to clean the display. Most of the time there is al lot of dirt, grease and what ever on it. 
- Lay it upside down and open it. You need some specific tools, just search on internet.
- Unscrew the 10 screens around the bottom. Take care to put the two at the ventilation opening (near the display) aside, these are smaller and must go back there.
- When opened, first unplug the battery.
- Then check what you got, and clean when needed. I sometimes use a vacuumcleaner on lowest power, with the big brush on it, and carefully go around. Do not vacuum clean the rubbers etc. they might just fly in.
  But most of the time, just a simple painting brush is enough to get some dirt out.
- The less you do in there, the better. It is easy to break something and hard to repair.
- Close it again
